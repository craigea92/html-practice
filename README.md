# Html Practice

## Project Description
For this project, I designed and developed a website to present my professional profile, leveraging fundamental HTML and CSS. I opted for this minimalist approach to facilitate deployment on Github's native hosting service.

Throughout the project, my major hurdles involved grappling with CSS and image placement. I overcame these hurdles through reading the documentation and applying a methodical approach.

As my career progresses, I plan to expand this website to encompass additional details about my experience and accomplishments, as well as links to my other completed projects.
